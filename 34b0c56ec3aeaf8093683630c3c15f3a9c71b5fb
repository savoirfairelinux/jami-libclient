      "message": "This should be in the private class, right? You can have a reload method (in case a state machine is overkill), but if I understand, the argument is the private data. It should not leak into the public API. In case it has to be called from somewhere else, make the private class \"public\" in LRC, but don\u0027t export it (see the _p.h files).",

      "message": "You still need to move it to the private class (and add the friend). \"private\" object methods are still exported. You can take a look at the code guidelines and other links I sometime copy paste here as to why it has to be done that way. It\u0027s not my invention and it always was quite unpleasant to deal with, but it proved to be necessary times and times again.",
