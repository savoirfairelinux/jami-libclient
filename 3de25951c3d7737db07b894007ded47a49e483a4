      "message": "It\u0027s a bad idea to \"randomly\" change the object collection. This breaks saving the contact in case it came from GMail or a local vCard.\n\nNot saying not doing so solves everything. It has it\u0027s own share of issues, but changing the collection make it worst.\n\nThe fact the LRC doesn\u0027t handle this well was a design decision discussed long ago. It was decides that the collection system was already over-engineered enough without having a `N-N` cardinality on the collections.",
