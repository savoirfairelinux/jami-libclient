# Introduction

Jami provides all its users a universal communication tool, autonomous, free, secure and built on a distributed architecture thus requiring no authority or central server to function.

`jami-qt` is the cross platform client for [Jami](https://jami.net/). For now, it's mainly used for the Windows platform and is not tested on other platforms.
