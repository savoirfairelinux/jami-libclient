But I wonder if you should not use ContactMethod here. This would allow, for example, to add a visual cue in the GUI when trying to call/search for a banned CM/URI. The API would also be slightly nicer:\n\n    auto cm \u003d PhoneDirectoryModel::instance().getNumber(uri, account);\n    cm-\u003esetBanStatus(Cetificate::Status::BANNED);",
