 * The purpose of this enum class is to mimic/extend the Qt::ItemDataRole in LRC so that the same
 * value is used when using a common role in the ::data() method of any model in LRC,
 * eg: the value of the Object role should not be different for the PersonModel and the CallModel.
 *
 * This is so that clients of LRC do need additional logic when trying to extract the same type of
 * data from multiple types of LRC models.
 *
 * Thus any data role which is common to multiple models in LRC should be defined here. Data roles
 * which are specific to the model can be defined within that model only and their value should
 * start with UserRole + 1
