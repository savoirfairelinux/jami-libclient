    * This class evaluate the overall security of an account.

    * a metric called SecurityLevel. This model should be used to:
    *
    * 1) List all potential flaws
    * 2) Decide if an account can be considered secure
    * 3) Decide if a call can be considered secure
    *
    * End users should not have to be security gurus to setup Ring. It is our
    * job to do as much as we can to make security configuration as transparent as
    * possible.
    *
    * The SecurityLevel is computed by checking all possible flaw. The level cannot be
    * higher than a flaw maximum security level. If there is 2 (or more) flaw in the same
    * maximum level, the maximum level will be decreased by one (recursively).
    *
    * A flaw severity is used by the client to display the right icon ( (i), /!\, [x] ).
