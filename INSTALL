Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

To install the appplication, type the following commands in a console, while in the root directory of this application:

	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<daemon_install_path> # Add -DENABLE_VIDEO=false to disable video support
	make -j3
	make install

Explanation
==================

This script will configure and prepare the compilation and installation of the program and correctly link it against Ring daemon.

All needed files will be built in "build" directory.
So you have to go to this directory:

	cd build

Then execute the Makefile, to compile the application (src, doc...)

	make

Then install it all using:

	make install

You have to use "sudo" to be able to install the program in a protected directory (which is the case by default and most of the time).
Therefore it will ask for your system password.

OS X Install
============

# Install necessary tools:
brew install cmake
brew install qt5
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path_to_qt5>

hint: default install location with HomeBrew is /usr/local/Cellar/qt5

# First make sure you have built ring daemon for OS X.

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir_of_daemon> [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug for compiling with debug symbols]
make

install_name_tool -change @rpath/libring.0.dylib @executable_path/libring.0.dylib libringclient.1.4.1.dylib
install_name_tool -id @executable_path/libringclient.1.4.1.dylib libringclient.1.4.1.dylib

# You can now use thes libraries in a QtCreator project. Don't forget to copy both dylibs inside
# your .app/Contents/MacOS/
